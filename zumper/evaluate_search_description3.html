The articulated faade of the building yields over 200 unique floor plans, which feature asymmetrical bay windows that expand into the apex of each curve. Stepping into these free form bays residents experience the city in a new perspective, and the sculptural qualities of the building itself become part of the view.The architects design extends beyond the exterior of the building and into the interiors themselves. Floor plans take advantage of the organic shape of the exterior, and, as a result, niches have been formed that offer the opportunity for reading, dining, or just reflecting on the spectacular view. Every window has been fitted with solar shades that filter light and offer privacy without obscuring views.Interior finishes and fixtures have all been designed and selected by the buildings architect, beginning with brushed stainless steel entry door hardware, inspired by the organic forms found in nature. Custom cabinetry in kitchens and baths is fabricated with vertical grain Douglas Fir, a material whose fine grain and amber coloring combine to create an effect that is both polished and warm. Tones of light and charcoal gray in brushed stainless steel appliances, chrome fixtures, porcelain tile flooring, and quartz countertops complement this warmth. All elements of the interiors combine to create an aesthetic that is comfortable, light and modern.A comprehensive array of lifestyle and valet services is available to the residents, including move-in coordination, the development of custom furniture packages, weekly fresh flower delivery and expert housekeeping.
