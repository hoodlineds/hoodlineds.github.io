<p>With hundreds of coffee shops to choose from, you don't have to walk very far to grab a cup of coffee in New York. But when it comes to getting the coffee you love - like, Starbucks, Dunkin' Donuts and Pret A Manger - how far do you actually have to go? 
 
<p>Using Yelp data to locate the geographical positioning of New York's most abundant coffee shop chains, Hoodline crunched the numbers to determine just how close these outposts exist in relation to one another - and how New York compares to other cities.
 
<p>Not surprisingly, New York's most prolific coffee shop chain is Starbucks, which is the country's largest coffee chain, with 12078 stores nationwide. There are 234 Starbucks locations in New York, and according to <a href="https://factfinder.census.gov/faces/nav/jsf/pages/index.xhtml">the most recent census projections</a>, that means there's roughly one Starbucks per 36485 residents (not including daily commuters and tourists). 
 
<p>Although the average distance between New York's Starbuck's is just under a quarter of a mile (904 feet), the shortest distance between two locations is 0 feet. That's how far it is between the Starbuck's at 399 Park Ave and the Starbuck's at 630 Lexington Ave. 
 
<p>The second most abundant coffee shop chain in New York is Dunkin' Donuts, with 210 locations citywide. 

<p>Compared to Starbuck's, when it comes to Peet's, the average distance between stores is 1777 feet.
