<p>With hundreds of coffee shops to choose from, you don't have to walk very far to grab a cup of coffee in Atlanta. But when it comes to getting the coffee you love - like, Starbucks, Dunkin' Donuts and Caribou Coffee - how far do you actually have to go? 
 
<p>Using Yelp data to locate the geographical positioning of Atlanta's most abundant coffee shop chains, Hoodline crunched the numbers to determine just how close these outposts exist in relation to one another - and how Atlanta compares to other cities.
 
<p>Not surprisingly, Atlanta's most prolific coffee shop chain is Starbucks, which is the country's largest coffee chain, with 12078 stores nationwide. There are 64 Starbucks locations in Atlanta, and according to <a href="https://factfinder.census.gov/faces/nav/jsf/pages/index.xhtml">the most recent census projections</a>, that means there's roughly one Starbucks per 7383 residents (not including daily commuters and tourists). 
 
<p>Although the average distance between Atlanta's Starbuck's is just under a quarter of a mile (4772 feet), the shortest distance between two locations is 0 feet. That's how far it is between the Starbuck's at 6000 N Terminal Pkwy, Terminal  F and the Starbuck's at 6000 N Terminal Pkwy. 
 
<p>The second most abundant coffee shop chain in Atlanta is Dunkin' Donuts, with 27 locations citywide. 

<p>Compared to Starbuck's, when it comes to Peet's, the average distance between stores is 19897 feet.
