<p>With hundreds of coffee shops to choose from, you don't have to walk very far to grab a cup of coffee in Austin. But when it comes to getting the coffee you love - like, Starbucks, The Coffee Bean & Tea Leaf and Austin Java - how far do you actually have to go? 
 
<p>Using Yelp data to locate the geographical positioning of Austin's most abundant coffee shop chains, Hoodline crunched the numbers to determine just how close these outposts exist in relation to one another - and how Austin compares to other cities.
 
<p>Not surprisingly, Austin's most prolific coffee shop chain is Starbucks, which is the country's largest coffee chain, with 12078 stores nationwide. There are 54 Starbucks locations in Austin, and according to <a href="https://factfinder.census.gov/faces/nav/jsf/pages/index.xhtml">the most recent census projections</a>, that means there's roughly one Starbucks per 17553 residents (not including daily commuters and tourists). 
 
<p>Although the average distance between Austin's Starbuck's is just under a quarter of a mile (6942 feet), the shortest distance between two locations is 114 feet. That's how far it is between the Starbuck's at 9300 S I H 35 and the Starbuck's at 9500 S Ih 35. 
 
<p>The second most abundant coffee shop chain in Austin is The Coffee Bean & Tea Leaf, with 6 locations citywide. 

<p>Compared to Starbuck's, when it comes to Peet's, the average distance between stores is 24660 feet. 
 
<p>San Francisco's third ________ .
