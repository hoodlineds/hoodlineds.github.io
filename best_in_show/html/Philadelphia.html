<p>With hundreds of coffee shops to choose from, you don't have to walk very far to grab a cup of coffee in Philadelphia. But when it comes to getting the coffee you love - like, Dunkin' Donuts, Starbucks and Au Bon Pain - how far do you actually have to go? 
 
<p>Using Yelp data to locate the geographical positioning of Philadelphia's most abundant coffee shop chains, Hoodline crunched the numbers to determine just how close these outposts exist in relation to one another - and how Philadelphia compares to other cities.
 
<p>Not surprisingly, Philadelphia's most prolific coffee shop chain is Dunkin' Donuts, which is the country's largest coffee chain, with 7941 stores nationwide. There are 135 Dunkin' Donuts locations in Philadelphia, and according to <a href="https://factfinder.census.gov/faces/nav/jsf/pages/index.xhtml">the most recent census projections</a>, that means there's roughly one Dunkin' Donuts per 11613 residents (not including daily commuters and tourists). 
 
<p>Although the average distance between Philadelphia's Starbuck's is just under a quarter of a mile (3258 feet), the shortest distance between two locations is 42 feet. That's how far it is between the Starbuck's at  and the Starbuck's at 1600 John F Kennedy Blvd, Suburban Station. 
 
<p>The second most abundant coffee shop chain in Philadelphia is Starbucks, with 51 locations citywide. 

<p>Compared to Starbuck's, when it comes to Peet's, the average distance between stores is 4262 feet.
