<p>With hundreds of coffee shops to choose from, you don't have to walk very far to grab a cup of coffee in Chicago. But when it comes to getting the coffee you love - like, Dunkin' Donuts, Starbucks and Au Bon Pain - how far do you actually have to go? 
 
<p>Using Yelp data to locate the geographical positioning of Chicago's most abundant coffee shop chains, Hoodline crunched the numbers to determine just how close these outposts exist in relation to one another - and how Chicago compares to other cities.
 
<p>Not surprisingly, Chicago's most prolific coffee shop chain is Dunkin' Donuts, which is the country's largest coffee chain, with 7941 stores nationwide. There are 242 Dunkin' Donuts locations in Chicago, and according to <a href="https://factfinder.census.gov/faces/nav/jsf/pages/index.xhtml">the most recent census projections</a>, that means there's roughly one Dunkin' Donuts per 11177 residents (not including daily commuters and tourists). 
 
<p>Although the average distance between Chicago's Starbuck's is just under a quarter of a mile (3095 feet), the shortest distance between two locations is 113 feet. That's how far it is between the Starbuck's at 100 W Randolph St and the Starbuck's at 100 W Randolph St, Ste 112. 
 
<p>The second most abundant coffee shop chain in Chicago is Starbucks, with 198 locations citywide. 

<p>Compared to Starbuck's, when it comes to Peet's, the average distance between stores is 2425 feet. 
 
<p>San Francisco's third ________ .
