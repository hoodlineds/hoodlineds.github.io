<p>With hundreds of coffee shops to choose from, you don't have to walk very far to grab a cup of coffee in Los Angeles. But when it comes to getting the coffee you love - like, Starbucks, The Coffee Bean & Tea Leaf and Peet's - how far do you actually have to go? 
 
<p>Using Yelp data to locate the geographical positioning of Los Angeles's most abundant coffee shop chains, Hoodline crunched the numbers to determine just how close these outposts exist in relation to one another - and how Los Angeles compares to other cities.
 
<p>Not surprisingly, Los Angeles's most prolific coffee shop chain is Starbucks, which is the country's largest coffee chain, with 12078 stores nationwide. There are 172 Starbucks locations in Los Angeles, and according to <a href="https://factfinder.census.gov/faces/nav/jsf/pages/index.xhtml">the most recent census projections</a>, that means there's roughly one Starbucks per 23118 residents (not including daily commuters and tourists). 
 
<p>Although the average distance between Los Angeles's Starbuck's is just under a quarter of a mile (4365 feet), the shortest distance between two locations is 0 feet. That's how far it is between the Starbuck's at 201 World Way, LAX Terminal 1 and the Starbuck's at 201 World Way. 
 
<p>The second most abundant coffee shop chain in Los Angeles is The Coffee Bean & Tea Leaf, with 55 locations citywide. 

<p>Compared to Starbuck's, when it comes to Peet's, the average distance between stores is 6079 feet.
