<p>With hundreds of coffee shops to choose from, you don't have to walk very far to grab a cup of coffee in Seattle. But when it comes to getting the coffee you love - like, Starbucks, Tully's Coffee and Cherry Street Coffee House - how far do you actually have to go? 
 
<p>Using Yelp data to locate the geographical positioning of Seattle's most abundant coffee shop chains, Hoodline crunched the numbers to determine just how close these outposts exist in relation to one another - and how Seattle compares to other cities.
 
<p>Not surprisingly, Seattle's most prolific coffee shop chain is Starbucks, which is the country's largest coffee chain, with 12078 stores nationwide. There are 135 Starbucks locations in Seattle, and according to <a href="https://factfinder.census.gov/faces/nav/jsf/pages/index.xhtml">the most recent census projections</a>, that means there's roughly one Starbucks per 5217 residents (not including daily commuters and tourists). 
 
<p>Although the average distance between Seattle's Starbuck's is just under a quarter of a mile (2163 feet), the shortest distance between two locations is 233 feet. That's how far it is between the Starbuck's at 4634 26th Ave NE and the Starbuck's at 2617 NE 46th St. 
 
<p>The second most abundant coffee shop chain in Seattle is Tully's Coffee, with 16 locations citywide. 

<p>Compared to Starbuck's, when it comes to Peet's, the average distance between stores is 9620 feet. 
 
<p>San Francisco's third ________ .
