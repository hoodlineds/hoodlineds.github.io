<p>With hundreds of coffee shops to choose from, you don't have to walk very far to grab a cup of coffee in Houston. But when it comes to getting the coffee you love - like, Starbucks, Dunkin' Donuts and Amille's Coffee - how far do you actually have to go? 
 
<p>Using Yelp data to locate the geographical positioning of Houston's most abundant coffee shop chains, Hoodline crunched the numbers to determine just how close these outposts exist in relation to one another - and how Houston compares to other cities.
 
<p>Not surprisingly, Houston's most prolific coffee shop chain is Starbucks, which is the country's largest coffee chain, with 12078 stores nationwide. There are 134 Starbucks locations in Houston, and according to <a href="https://factfinder.census.gov/faces/nav/jsf/pages/index.xhtml">the most recent census projections</a>, that means there's roughly one Starbucks per 17190 residents (not including daily commuters and tourists). 
 
<p>Although the average distance between Houston's Starbuck's is just under a quarter of a mile (5866 feet), the shortest distance between two locations is 0 feet. That's how far it is between the Starbuck's at 1200 McKinney St, Ste 373 and the Starbuck's at 1200 Mckinney St, Ste 476. 
 
<p>The second most abundant coffee shop chain in Houston is Dunkin' Donuts, with 14 locations citywide. 

<p>Compared to Starbuck's, when it comes to Peet's, the average distance between stores is 24231 feet.
