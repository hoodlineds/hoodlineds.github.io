<p>With hundreds of coffee shops to choose from, you don't have to walk very far to grab a cup of coffee in Washington. But when it comes to getting the coffee you love - like, Starbucks, Dunkin' Donuts and Au Bon Pain - how far do you actually have to go? 
 
<p>Using Yelp data to locate the geographical positioning of Washington's most abundant coffee shop chains, Hoodline crunched the numbers to determine just how close these outposts exist in relation to one another - and how Washington compares to other cities.
 
<p>Not surprisingly, Washington's most prolific coffee shop chain is Starbucks, which is the country's largest coffee chain, with 12078 stores nationwide. There are 94 Starbucks locations in Washington, and according to <a href="https://factfinder.census.gov/faces/nav/jsf/pages/index.xhtml">the most recent census projections</a>, that means there's roughly one Starbucks per 7246 residents (not including daily commuters and tourists). 
 
<p>Although the average distance between Washington's Starbuck's is just under a quarter of a mile (2362 feet), the shortest distance between two locations is 292 feet. That's how far it is between the Starbuck's at 775 12th St NW and the Starbuck's at 1000 H St NW. 
 
<p>The second most abundant coffee shop chain in Washington is Dunkin' Donuts, with 27 locations citywide. 

<p>Compared to Starbuck's, when it comes to Peet's, the average distance between stores is 4624 feet.
